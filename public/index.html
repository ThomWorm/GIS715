            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Final Project Visualization</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 1, 2020</p>
                  
                  
                  <p class = "tab"> My research currently focuses on assessing the probability of arrival of agricultural pests, on a global scale in conjunction with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 
                Our model is in the very early stages of development, with our basic structure having only been approved by our stakeholders about two weeks ago. As a result, several lab members have been 
                playing around with a suite of different visualization tools to so we can begin sketching out a dashboard both to present as a final product to our stakeholders, and to allow our own 
                interpretation of the complex networks that we are working with. Our model (at this moment in time) assess the probability of a given pests arrival as a function of it's presence and distribution in the 
                host country, the propagule pressure (in this case, trade volume), and phytosanitary measures conducted on departure or arrival. Several lab mates are currently working on a geographic display of some of this data
                - essentially an interactive global chloropleth with lines, representing trade volume between countries of interest. While such a vizualization is instantly familiar to the viewer, it utilizes one of the most imporant
                dimensions of the graph - the x and y space, to visualize the distance between countries. From an ecological or biological perspective, trade on airplances happens instantly and trade of fresh plant parts in refrigerated 
                ships happens nearly instantly - in other words, the distance between countries is a relatively insignificant component of the risk, to the point that it may not need to be considered. To free up this visual space,
                I am working on a network based visualization of our model output so that data can potentially be encoded by the relationships between the nodes. However,our model does not currently produce meaningful output 
                based on real-world data. Rather, it is currently running on some simple simulated data I generated on trade volumes between countires, phytosanitary compliance and species presence. </p>
                <br>

                   <p>Because I have no experience working with or visualizing networks, I initially gravitated towards building simple networks of our model in R, both because that is the language I am most comfortable in and becauseit is 
                the language I used to create our simulated data. The apparently most commonly used graph-visualization package in R is iGraph, which has a large suite of built-in visualization tools as well as support for 
                the Dot language - a common way to store graph structure that is used by gephi, graphviz and other visualization tools. This package allowed me to assign most of the attributes of our model to diferent aspects of the graph.
                Node color represented probability, node edge color represented arrival phytosanitary compliance, edgethickness represented trade volume and edge color represented departure phytosanitary compliance. Node size was free to encode
                additional information as needed. A simple output (a sketch of sorts) using iGraph using the described encoding is availible above. </p>
                <br>
                <p> <img src="./imgs/simple.PNG" alt="Simple graph sketch"> </p>

                 <p> As I began to scale up the data to the 240 countries in our model, it became quickly evident that signficiant filtering of values was needed to improve readibility. Graphs with more than 15 or 20 nodes quickly become overwhelming and 
                uninterpretable, as seen by the graph above, already filtered to just all countries trading with Korea. </p>

                <p><img src="./imgs/korrisk.PNG" alt="Simple graph sketch"> </p>


                <br>

                  <p>As I interacted more with the package, I realized that support for drawing node border thickness in the R version iGraph had been dropped (seemingly by error) and had not been supported by any version of iGraph for
                many years and the capacity to build interactive tools to modify the graph on the fly was limited. I then moved to implementing the same style of graphs in the python version of iGraph, which
                reportedly supports drawing node borders. After several hours, it became apparent that the python version of iGraph lacks support for many of the features I had used in R and is a much more limited version of the software.
                Finally, I moved to the networkX package in python, which is the most commonly used tool for graph visualization and analysis in python. NetworkX has good support for pyplot and as an extension, has good support for
                making interactive visualizations with Dash. After reviewing my R-iGraph sketches with our APHIS stakeholders on 4/30, my lab came to the conclusion that a simple tool to allow the selection and filtering of individual countries, one at a time to the model
                would be the most helpful initial visualization as we began to migrate our model to real world data. A simple implementation of that interactive model output, built using plotly and Dash and hosted by heroku is availible below.
                This interactive visualization allows for the selection of individual countries as nodes using the checkbox list, and visualizes the risk of invasion as node color and arrival phytosanitary compliance as node border color. It also 
                allows for the selection of different graph layouts, to improve readability. Node names are availible on hover to decrease visual clutter with >10 nodes. </p>

                <p>
                Unfortunately, although pyplot is the way most users visualize their networkX graphs, it does not seem to offer support for graphing directed graphs ( edges as direction arrows). Although I found some incredibly hacky
                solutions to this problem online (leveraging dramatically offset and reized wingdings-style triangles as arrowheads), I could not get any of them to work in a satisfactory manner after substatial effort.  The other significant downside to using NetworkX 
                instead of iGraph is that it does not allow the setting of individual edge attributes. Rather, edges are called by a referencing a pre-made style. This is a rather inflexible method of visualization for networks that
                rely heavily on node attributes. As I continue in my investigation, I may switch to a different visualization package again that offers more support for edges without having to generate hundreds of unique styles.   </p>
