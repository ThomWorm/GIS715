  This dashboard allows the user to visualize the relationship between earthquake depth, frequency
  and distance from the trench. Earthquakes are driven by the subduction of the cold, dense oceanic crust below more bouyant continental crust. 
  As a result, most earth quakes occur in the trench formed by the contact between the downgoing slab and the continentnal crust. However, this 
  location is relatively shallow in depthj (0-10 km) and earthquakes occur up to 700 km depth. These deep earthquakes are caused by several factors, but the deepest 
  (seen as an increase in occurance at 550 -650 km depth) is mostly caused by phase transitions in 
  the minerals in the subducting slab as the experience higher pressure regimes. This same phemomenon shows up in the map where 
  the deepest earthquakes are significantly far inboard of the subducting slab as much as a few hundred KM. MY goal for 
  this visualization was to allow the user to compare the difference between the frequency of earthquakes and their depths.
  My undergraduate research focused a bit on better understanding these deep, rare earthquakes and I hope by linking the frequency of occurance
  to the depth and location, I can allow other interested users to appreciate the fascinating world of subduction.
